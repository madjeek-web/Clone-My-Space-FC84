The project "Clone My Space" is a software for Windows, Mac, Linux, etc., that allows users to connect to an online website. Developed in Python, it uses Tkinter to create a user-friendly interface. This project demonstrates the basic principles of client-server architecture and user authentication.
Its purpose is to verify user credentials via a PHP API. Users enter their username and password into a form, which, when submitted, sends a POST request to a remote server.
The technologies used include Python for the application logic, Tkinter for the graphical interface, and the requests library for handling HTTP requests. The PHP server, which receives the credentials, performs the verification and returns a success or error message.
